Started programming in high school and took part in many school competitions, but started programming more seriously at the university.
I prefer to work in a team, I worked in different teams from 3 to 20 people, but if necessary, I can work alone. I am very sociable, I quickly join the team.
I like to spend my free time with colleagues and friends, usually we prefer such activities, like hiking, kayaking, going to bars, board games or playing volleyball.


I have been working with web technologies more than 5 years and mostly it was projects on Rails. So I worked on a variety of projects such as an eLearning platform, a small social network, a game backend, and a few smaller projects. Some of them had monolithic architecture, but most of them are based on micro-services.
As for databases, I have a good experience with MySQL, PostgreSQL. Also, I worked with the NoSQL database - Redis. Talking about tests, I think that it is very important to write tests. On projects I commonly worked with RSpec and have experience in Capybara.
Sometimes I was involved in some DevOps processes, so I have some experience with GCP, GitHub Actions, Heroku, AWS and Docker, and GitLab CI.
For the last six months I have been in the current project as a team leader of an integration feature
